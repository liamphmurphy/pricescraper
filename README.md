# pricescraper
The end goal of this program is to type in the name of a product (e.g Ryzen 7 1700) and scrape various sites, list the results, and determine the best price.

Currently, it is just a CLI tool, but hope to turn it into a django app at some time in the future. 

lxml is required.
 
```
pip install lxml
```

Then, run scrape.py normally.

```
python scrape.py
```
